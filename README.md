# OfferFit Take Home Assignment

Project Demo: https://world-grocer-challenge.vercel.app/

This application, developed in Vue.js, serves as a data visualization tool designed to assist stakeholders of the World Grocer, a premium grocery chain, in analyzing the performance of a next-generation marketing personalization solution. This solution is implemented over a two-month period known as the "go live & measure uplift" period.

The core functionality of the application revolves around displaying aggregated statistics up to a specific date chosen by the user. This includes:

- Total offers sent to all customers
- Total repeaters (separated by the experimental group vs. the control group)
- Total Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), separated by the experimental group vs. the control group.

The application also features a daily trending view of CLV, differentiated between the experimental and control groups.
